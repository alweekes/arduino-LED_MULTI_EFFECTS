# arduino-LED_MULTI_EFFECTS
Arduino sketch which is a modification of the sketch here https://www.tweaking4all.com/hardware/arduino/arduino-all-ledstrip-effects-in-one/. I've added an indicator LED to show which effect is on use and some solid colour effects so it can be used for simple illumination only, for a desk lighting application.
